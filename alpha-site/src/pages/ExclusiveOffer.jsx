		<p>These Terms of Use (along with any other documents referred to here) outline the terms and conditions under which you can use or access our website, www.alphaway.com, its subdomains, or any related websites and mobile apps (collectively referred to as “Our Sites”), whether you’re a guest or a registered user. Using our Sites means accessing, browsing, or creating an account. If you log in via a third-party service (like Facebook, Google, etc.), these terms still apply when you access our Sites.</p>
<p>Please read these terms carefully before using our Sites. By continuing to use our Sites, you agree to these terms.</p>
<p>If you don’t agree with these terms, please don’t use our Sites.</p>
<h4>1. Other Relevant Terms</h4>
<p>These Terms of Use refer to additional terms that apply to your use of our Sites. These additional terms will be listed separately and also apply when you use our Sites.</p>
<h4>2. About Us</h4>
<p>Registered office of Alphaway Global Student Consulting Services FZCO is Building A1, Dubai Digital Park, Dubai Silicon Oasis, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</p>
<h4>3. Accessing Our Sites</h4>
<p>We don’t guarantee that our Sites will always be available or error-free. Access to our Sites is temporary, and we may suspend, withdraw, or modify parts of our Sites without notice. We’re not responsible if our Sites aren’t available at any given time.</p>
<p>You’re responsible for making sure you have the necessary setup to access our Sites. You also need to ensure that anyone else who uses our Sites via your internet connection follows these terms.</p>
<h4>4. Your Account and Password</h4>
<p>To register on our Sites, you need to be at least 18 years old or 13 or older with your parent/guardian’s consent. You must also be legally allowed to enter into a contract.</p>
<p>If you’re given a username, password, or other security info as part of your account setup, keep it confidential and don’t share it with anyone.</p>
<p>We may disable your account or login details at any time if we believe you’ve violated these terms or if we suspect unauthorized use.</p>
<p>If you suspect someone else has your login info, contact us immediately at contact@alphaway.com. We may ask you to set up a new account or reset your password.</p>
<h4>5. Agreements Between Users of Our Sites</h4>
<p>Our Sites let property owners and managers (“Advertisers”) list properties for potential student tenants (“Students”).</p>
<p>You can use our Sites either as a guest or registered user. Once you find a property that suits you, you can make an enquiry and submit a booking request, which will include your contact info and the length of your stay. No payment is required at this stage, and there’s no commitment to rent a property. Our team will follow up to confirm the details of your accommodation request.</p>
<p>Please note that we don’t own or manage any properties listed on our Sites, and we are not part of any agreements between Advertisers and Students. The terms of your agreement with an Advertiser (such as payment terms, cancellation policies, etc.) are your responsibility to review and accept. We don’t negotiate or validate agreements between the parties.</p>
<p>We also don’t verify the identity of Advertisers or Students. If you’re working with a third-party agent, it’s up to you to ensure they’re providing accurate information. We encourage you to communicate directly with the other party to confirm details.</p>
<p>By submitting your contact info, you agree that Alphaway may contact you via email, phone, or SMS to assist you or send you marketing material.</p>
<h4>6. Pricing</h4>
<p>Prices for properties listed on our Sites may change at any time. While we do our best to ensure accuracy, there may be errors in the prices listed. If we notice a pricing error before your booking is completed, we reserve the right to correct it.</p>
<p>We display prices provided by Advertisers, but we’re not responsible for their accuracy. Since our Sites are international, prices may vary depending on your location and the current exchange rates. These rates are for guidance only and may not reflect the actual price.</p>
<p>Sometimes, third parties may offer promotions or coupons on our Sites. Be sure to check the terms of any coupons, as they may have restrictions or expiration dates.</p>
<h4>7. Payments</h4>
<p>If you make a payment to an Advertiser via our Sites, it’s handled by a payment provider like Stripe. You’re responsible for understanding the Advertiser’s payment and cancellation policies before completing a transaction. Any deposit you pay is held by the Advertiser, not by Alphaway.</p>
<p>At the end of your tenancy, you’ll need to contact the Advertiser directly to retrieve any deposit you’ve paid.</p>
<h4>8. Changes and Cancellations</h4>
<p>Any tenancy agreement is strictly between you (the Student) and the Advertiser. It’s your responsibility to check the Advertiser’s cancellation policy before you make a booking.</p>
<h4>9. Intellectual Property</h4>
<p>We own or have the license to all intellectual property rights related to our Sites and any content published on them. All such rights are protected by copyright laws. All rights are reserved.</p>
<h4>10. Linking to Our Sites</h4>
<p>You can link to our homepage as long as you do so in a legal and fair way, without harming our reputation or taking advantage of it. You must not suggest any kind of association, approval, or endorsement by us unless it’s expressly stated.</p>
<p>You cannot create a link to any part of our Sites other than the homepage, and you can’t frame our Sites on other websites.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to remove linking permission at any time.</p>
<h4>11. Third-Party Links</h4>
<p>Our Sites may contain links to third-party websites or resources for your convenience. We have no control over those sites or their content.</p>
<p>If our Sites include maps provided by Google, their use is governed by Google’s terms and conditions, available here:<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/help/terms_maps.html"> Google Maps Terms</a>.</p>
<h4>12. Changes to These Terms</h4>
<p>We may update these terms from time to time. When we make changes, we’ll update this page and may announce it on our homepage. If you don’t agree with the changes, please stop using our Sites.</p>
<h4>13. Governing Law</h4>
<p>If you’re a consumer, these terms are governed by English law. Both you and we agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales. However, this doesn’t prevent you from bringing a claim in your country of residence if your local laws allow you to do so.</p>
